Hey there! I'm Mohammadreza, also known as MamadXV, hailing from Iran at the age of 16. I've delved into languages like C#, Python, and JSON, and currently, I'm diving into Unity and exploring other programming languages. With a background in Discord bot development, I've crafted several bots and continue to do so. My passion lies in crafting Android applications and games, striving to make life easier for others through my programming endeavors.
